# Project 5 Create our first PHP blog

Background information

That's it, you took the plunge! The world of web development with PHP is within reach and you need visibility to convince your future employers/clients at a glance. You are a PHP developer, so it's time to show your talents through a blog in your colors.
Description of the need

The project is therefore to develop your professional blog. This website is divided into two main groups of pages:

    pages useful to all visitors;
    the pages to administer your blog.

Here is the list of pages that should be accessible from your website:

    the home page;
    the page listing all the blogs posts;
    the page displaying a blog post;
    the page allowing to add a blog post;
    the page allowing to modify a blog post.
    pages allowing to modify/delete a blog post;
    the login/registration pages of users.

You will develop an administration part that should be accessible only to registered and validated users.

The administration pages will therefore be accessible on conditions and you will ensure the security of the administration part.

Let's start with the pages that are useful to all Internet users.

On the home page you will need to present the following information:

        Your first and last name;
        A photo and/or logo;
        A catchphrase that looks like you ( example: "Martin Durand, the developer you need!");
        A menu allowing you to navigate through all the pages of your website;
        A contact form (at the submission of this form, an email with all this information will be   sent to you) with the following fields:
        surname/first name
        contact email
        message
        a link to your CV in pdf format;
        and all the links to the social networks where we can follow you (Github, LinkedIn,   Twitter...).

On the page listing all blogs posts (from the most recent to the oldest), you must display the following information for each blog post:

    the title ;
    the date of last modification;
    the châpo ;
    and a link to the blog post.

On the page presenting the details of a post blog, you should display the following information:

    the title ;
    the chapô ;
    the content;
    the author ;
    the date of the last update;
    the form to add a comment (submitted for validation);
    lists of validated and published comments.

On the page allowing to modify a post blog, the user has the possibility to modify the title, chapô, author and content fields.

In the footer menu, there must be a link to access the blog administration.
